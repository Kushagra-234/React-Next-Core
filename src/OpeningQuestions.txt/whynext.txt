 why we chose nextjs over reactjs 

 We chose Next.js over plain React because in Web3 DApps the JavaScript bundle is already heavy due to wallet logic and RPC interactions.

With React CSR, the initial HTML is empty and the UI waits for the entire JS bundle to load, which affects the first render.

Next.js allowed us to server-render the UI and fetch non-wallet-dependent blockchain data like chain metadata, token configs, and public contract reads using viem.

Wallet-specific logic such as account state and balances was kept in client-side components using wagmi, so it didn’t block the initial render.

This separation helped reduce the initial JS workload and improved perceived performance.

Additionally, file-based routing, API routes, and less boilerplate helped us ship features faster compared to setting up everything manually in React.
