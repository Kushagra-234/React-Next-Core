Since I work in a Web3 startup, our application heavily depends on asynchronous data like wallet connections, RPC calls, and on-chain reads and writes.

Initially, this caused a lot of UI issues — components were managing their own async logic, which made the app laggy and state updates inconsistent.

To solve this, I proposed and implemented a centralized API layer, where all data-fetching and blockchain interaction logic was moved out of components.

On top of that, we created custom hooks for on-chain reads and writes, which helped standardize data flow and ensured UI state stayed in sync across the app.

This significantly reduced bugs related to stale state, improved performance, and made the codebase much easier to maintain and scale.


how did it solve problem and increased performance 
Prop drilling was causing unnecessary re-renders due to nested async data. RTK Query isolated updates at the query level, so only dependent components re-rendered when their data changed.
also rtk query caches data ,badges updates and thus reudces re-renders 


okay if multiple components call same query tb component A calls it and then store me cache ho jaata hai and used by component B and component C
