 // steps to create a scalable frontend app 

 requirement gathering 
1-  type of app (dashboard,SEO heavy,admin panel dashboard)

server Logic -
use of centralized api layer for all data fetching prefereably rtk 
consistent use of loading,error,success states 
this provides caching,invalidate tags and all itslef 

segregation of code in if reusable 
custom hooks 

optimization techniques 
lazy loading
memoization only when required 
virtualization in heavy data sets of table 
accessiblity of user via input focus 
consistent styling 
image optimization 
env config seperation sensivitve keys via server 


fallbacks 
suspense boundaries 
error boundaries 

security -
HTTP only cookie 
CSRF tokens for protection against CSRF attacks 
no tokens in localstorage only http cookie

maybe eslint,prettier for formatting and consistent 
 

 sentry,logger for logging
